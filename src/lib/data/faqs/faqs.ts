		content: `
            <p>Each session begins with a short check-in to understand how you\'re feeling that day. From there, I\'ll tailor the reflexology treatment to your needs — working gently and intentionally to support your body\'s natural healing.</p>

		value: '3',
		title: 'Is this right for me if I\’ve already tried lots of other treatments?',
		content: '<p>Yes. I often work with people who\’ve seen specialists, tried medications, or done years of physio. This approach focuses on helping your body return to balance — not just treating the surface symptoms.</p>'

		title: 'What if I\’m dealing with several issues at once?',

	{
		value: '0',
		title: "How do I know you\'re the right person to help me?",
		content: `
            <p>The most important thing is that you feel safe, listened to, and not rushed. My approach is gentle and grounded — I take time to understand what your body\’s holding onto and work with it, not against it. Many clients say they felt a deep shift simply from being in a calm, attentive space.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '1',
		title: 'What makes this different from other treatments I\'ve tried?',
		content: `
            <p>This isn\'t just a pressure-point routine. My work focuses on reconnecting you with how your body actually feels, beneath the noise. I work slowly, intuitively, and always adapt to what your nervous system is ready for — no pushing, no ticking boxes.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '2',
		title: 'Is this approach evidence-based or just \'alternative\'?',
		content: `
            <p>Reflexology has been used for centuries across different cultures, and today, many aspects of this practice are supported by modern research — especially around relaxation, circulation, and nervous system regulation. I don\'t make medical claims — I support your body\'s natural capacity to heal and settle. The results my clients get are the evidence I seek to create.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'What if I’ve never done anything like this before?',
		content: `
            <p>That\’s completely fine. You don\’t need to prepare or have any prior experience. My work is simple, grounding, and respectful — most clients say they felt at ease within the first few minutes of arriving.</p>

	},
	{
		value: '4',
		title: 'Will I be expected to talk about personal issues?',

            <p>Not at all. You\’re welcome to share whatever feels comfortable, but there\’s no pressure to open up. Some people speak the whole way through. Others say nothing and simply rest. Both are welcome.</p>

export const services_faqs: FAQ[] = [
	{
		value: '0',
		title: 'Do I need to know exactly what treatment to book?',
		content: `
            <p>Yes — you\'ll need to select a specific reflexology treatment when booking. Each treatment is designed with a different focus and duration. If you\'re unsure, take a look at the treatments page or contact me for guidance.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '1',
		title: 'What if I want support with multiple issues?',
		content: `
            <p>That\'s absolutely okay. Many clients come with overlapping concerns — tension, fatigue, hormonal imbalance, and more. Reflexology works holistically to support your whole system, not just isolated symptoms.</p>
        `

export const reflexology_faqs: FAQ[] = [
	{
		value: '0',
		title: 'Is reflexology just a fancy foot massage?',
		content: `
            <p>Not quite. A foot massage focuses on comfort and loosening muscles. Reflexology is more intentional: each touch targets a mapped point linked to a body system. For example, pressing one area might help settle digestion; another may ease tension in the neck. It\’s structured, purposeful, and whole-body in its intent.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '1',
		title: 'Does reflexology actually work?',
		content: `
            <p>Many people find it helps ease tension, improve sleep, reduce discomfort, and feel more emotionally grounded. Studies have shown promising effects on pain, fatigue, and anxiety — but like most holistic treatments, results vary. One thing is certain: the deep relaxation reflexology provides is real and beneficial on its own.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '2',
		title: 'Is reflexology safe?',
		content: `
            <p>Yes — for most people, it\’s very safe. It\’s non-invasive and gentle. That said, if you\’re pregnant, have a recent injury, or a medical condition like blood clots, always check with your doctor first. If anything feels too sensitive during your session, I\’ll adjust immediately.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'Can it help with specific issues like fatigue or hormone imbalance?',
		content: `
            <p>It can support the body in restoring balance — which is why so many people come to reflexology for exactly those reasons. Many of my clients report improvements in sleep, energy, mood, and even menstrual regularity over time. It\’s not a “cure,” but it helps your system settle and reset.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '4',
		title: 'How does a session actually work?',
		content: `
            <p>You\’ll lie back fully clothed while I work on your feet (or hands/face, if preferred). I apply gentle, focused pressure to specific points using thumbs and fingers. It\’s calming, never painful. Most people deeply relax or even fall asleep. You\’ll leave feeling lighter, more grounded, and more connected to your body.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '5',
		title: 'Do I need to believe in it for it to work?',
		content: `
            <p>No belief required. This isn\’t magic — it\’s about calming your nervous system and supporting your body to do what it naturally knows how to do. You can be curious, skeptical, or somewhere in between. Just come as you are.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '6',
		title: 'Can reflexology replace medical treatment?',
		content: `
            <p>No. Reflexology is a supportive therapy — not a medical diagnosis or cure. It\’s best used alongside your usual care, not instead of it. If something\’s going on with your health, always check with your GP.</p>
