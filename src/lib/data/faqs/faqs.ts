            <p>Each session begins with a short check-in to understand how you\’re feeling that day. From there, I\’ll tailor the treatment to your needs — working gently and intentionally within the scope of the service you\’ve booked (either Reflexology or Massage).</p>

            <p>Yes, you\’ll need to select your treatment type when you book. If you\'re unsure, here\’s a simple guide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reflexology helps the body rebalance itself from within, especially when there\’s stress, pain, or hormonal shifts.</li>
                <li>Massage works more directly with muscle tension, physical tightness, or the need for deep relaxation.</li>

		value: '3',
		title: 'Is this right for me if I\’ve already tried lots of other treatments?',

		title: "How do I know you\'re the right person to help me?",
		content: `
            <p>The most important thing is that you feel safe, listened to, and not rushed. My approach is gentle and grounded — I take time to understand what your body\’s holding onto and work with it, not against it. Many clients say they felt a deep shift simply from being in a calm, attentive space.</p>

		value: '1',
		title: 'What makes this different from other treatments I\’ve tried?',
		content: `
            <p>This isn\’t just a massage or pressure-point routine. My work focuses on reconnecting you with how your body actually feels, beneath the noise. I work slowly, intuitively, and always adapt to what your nervous system is ready for — no pushing, no ticking boxes.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '2',
		title: 'Is this approach evidence-based or just \‘alternative\’?',
		content: `
            <p>Reflexology and massage have both been used for centuries across different cultures, and today, many aspects of these practices are supported by modern research — especially around relaxation, circulation, and nervous system regulation. I don\’t make medical claims — I support your body\’s natural capacity to heal and settle. The results my clients get are the evidence I seek to create.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'What if I’ve never done anything like this before?',
		content: `
            <p>That\’s completely fine. You don\’t need to prepare or have any prior experience. My work is simple, grounding, and respectful — most clients say they felt at ease within the first few minutes of arriving.</p>

		title: 'Do I need to know exactly what treatment to book?',

            <p>Yes — you\’ll need to select a specific treatment when booking (Reflexology or Massage). If you\’re unsure which one is right for you, take a look at the Reflexology and Massage pages for more detail. Each treatment is designed with a different focus and intention.</p>

		value: '1',
		title: 'Can I switch between Reflexology and Massage on the day?',
		content: `
            <p>No — each treatment is prepared in advance based on what you\’ve booked. Reflexology and Massage are different approaches, and the space, tools, and timing are tailored accordingly.</p>

		value: '2',
		title: 'What if I want support with multiple issues?',
		content: `
            <p>That\’s absolutely okay. Many clients come with overlapping concerns — tension, fatigue, hormonal imbalance, and more. The key is to choose the treatment style that most resonates with what your body needs right now.</p>

	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'How do I know if Reflexology or Massage is better for me?',
		content: `
            <p>Reflexology is great if you\’re looking for deep support with your body\’s internal balance — hormones, sleep, digestion, mood. Massage is more hands-on and focused on physical tension and nervous system reset. You can read more about each here and here.</p>

export const reflexology_faqs: FAQ[] = [
	{
		value: '0',
		title: 'Is reflexology just a fancy foot massage?',
		content: `
            <p>Not quite. A foot massage focuses on comfort and loosening muscles. Reflexology is more intentional: each touch targets a mapped point linked to a body system. For example, pressing one area might help settle digestion; another may ease tension in the neck. It\’s structured, purposeful, and whole-body in its intent.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '1',
		title: 'Does reflexology actually work?',
		content: `
            <p>Many people find it helps ease tension, improve sleep, reduce discomfort, and feel more emotionally grounded. Studies have shown promising effects on pain, fatigue, and anxiety — but like most holistic treatments, results vary. One thing is certain: the deep relaxation reflexology provides is real and beneficial on its own.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '2',
		title: 'Is reflexology safe?',
		content: `
            <p>Yes — for most people, it\’s very safe. It\’s non-invasive and gentle. That said, if you\’re pregnant, have a recent injury, or a medical condition like blood clots, always check with your doctor first. If anything feels too sensitive during your session, I\’ll adjust immediately.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'Can it help with specific issues like fatigue or hormone imbalance?',
		content: `
            <p>It can support the body in restoring balance — which is why so many people come to reflexology for exactly those reasons. Many of my clients report improvements in sleep, energy, mood, and even menstrual regularity over time. It\’s not a “cure,” but it helps your system settle and reset.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '4',
		title: 'How does a session actually work?',
		content: `
            <p>You\’ll lie back fully clothed while I work on your feet (or hands/face, if preferred). I apply gentle, focused pressure to specific points using thumbs and fingers. It\’s calming, never painful. Most people deeply relax or even fall asleep. You\’ll leave feeling lighter, more grounded, and more connected to your body.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '5',
		title: 'Do I need to believe in it for it to work?',
		content: `
            <p>No belief required. This isn\’t magic — it\’s about calming your nervous system and supporting your body to do what it naturally knows how to do. You can be curious, skeptical, or somewhere in between. Just come as you are.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '6',
		title: 'Can reflexology replace medical treatment?',
		content: `
            <p>No. Reflexology is a supportive therapy — not a medical diagnosis or cure. It\’s best used alongside your usual care, not instead of it. If something\’s going on with your health, always check with your GP.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '7',
		title: 'When should I choose a massage instead of reflexology?',
		content: `
            <p>If your main goal is to release deep muscular tension or physical tightness in a specific area — like your back, legs, or shoulders — massage may be the better fit. Reflexology works holistically and indirectly through pressure points; massage works directly on the tissue. If you\’re unsure, you can always read about both on the website before you book.</p>

		title: 'What\’s the difference between Aithein Healing Massage and a regular massage?',
		content: `
            <p>Aithein Healing Massage blends deep tissue work with gentle, intuitive touch. It\’s not just about muscle relief — it\’s about calming the nervous system, releasing stored tension, and reconnecting with your body. Each session is deeply focused and fully tailored to what your body can receive that day.</p>
        `

	{
		value: '1',
		title: 'Is this a deep tissue massage?',
		content: `
            <p>It includes deep tissue techniques — but applied mindfully, not forcefully. The pressure adjusts to your body\’s readiness. There\’s no forcing, no “pushing through” pain. Just a safe space to release, reset, and restore at your own pace.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '2',
		title: 'What\’s the difference between massage and reflexology?',
		content: `
            <p>Massage works directly on the muscles to release tightness and physical stress. Reflexology works indirectly, through mapped points on the feet (or hands/face) that correspond to your internal systems. If you want direct relief for tight areas, massage may be right. If you\'re looking to support your whole system — digestion, sleep, hormones, stress — reflexology is often more helpful.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '3',
		title: 'What happens in a session?',
		content: `
            <p>You\’ll be gently guided to relax fully while I use slow, attentive movements to release tension across the body. Sessions are long and unhurried, especially the full-body option. You\’ll be warmly held, physically and emotionally — and encouraged to fully let go.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '4',
		title: 'Do I need to undress fully?',
		content: `
            <p>Only as much as you\'re comfortable with. You’ll always be covered with towels, and I’ll only uncover the areas being worked on. This is a space of complete care and consent.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '5',
		title: 'Is this suitable if I’m going through emotional stress?',
		content: `
            <p>Absolutely. Many people find this massage helps with both physical and emotional release. It’s common to feel lighter, more present, or even teary afterward — all part of your system letting go.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '6',
		title: 'Can this help with sleep, burnout, or anxiety?',
		content: `
            <p>Yes. Massage can calm the body’s stress response, slow your breathing, and guide you back into a sense of safety and rest. It doesn’t “fix” everything, but it gives your system the chance to slow down and recalibrate.</p>
        `
	},
	{
		value: '7',
		title: 'Is there anything I need to do before or after a session?',
		content: `
            <p>Just arrive on time and well-hydrated. After the session, give yourself time to rest if possible — especially after longer treatments. Some people feel emotional or tired afterward; this is normal. Drink water, move gently, and let the benefits settle in.</p>
